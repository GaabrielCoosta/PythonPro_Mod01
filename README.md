Ⓜ️ *Challenge proposed by Mentorama Programming School*

### Knowledge obtained:
  - Modulation, packages and imports
  - TDD and Unit Testing
  
**CHALLENGE**:

Develop an application with the following characteristics:
  - The application asks the user to enter a natural number
  - If the number is a multiple of 5, the application must print the word "fizz"
  - If the number is a multiple of 7, the application must print the word "buzz"
  - If the number is multiple of both, the application must print the word "fizzbuzz"
  - If the number is not a multiple of both, the application must print the word "miss"
  - Use the IDE of your choice
  - The function that identifies whether a number is a multiple of 5 or 7 must be created in a separate file and imported by the application
  - Development must be done in a Virtual Own environment
  
  ## Running the codes
- Requirements: Python 3+

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/GaabrielCoosta/PythonPro_Mod01

# Enter the folder
