**TDD Cycles:**

**Note the existence of three cycles:**

  - **Red**: write a small automated test that, when run, will fail;
  - **Green**: Implement code that is sufficient to pass the newly written test;
  - **Refactor**: refactor the code in order to improve it, making it more functional and cleaner.
  
  
To perform testing on each feature of your code, you will always follow these cycles. These cycles are commonly referred to as red-green-refactor or red-green-blue.
  
  
  
  
**üìöCHALLENGE**:

Develop an application with the following characteristics:
  - The application asks the user to enter a natural number
  - If the number is a multiple of 5, the application must print the word "fizz"
  - If the number is a multiple of 7, the application must print the word "buzz"
  - If the number is multiple of both, the application must print the word "fizzbuzz"
  - If the number is not a multiple of both, the application must print the word "miss"
  - Use the IDE of your choice
  - The function that identifies whether a number is a multiple of 5 or 7 must be created in a separate file and imported by the application
  - Development must be done in a Virtual Own environment
  
  ## Running the codes
- Requirements: Python 3+

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/GaabrielCoosta/PythonPro_Mod01

# Enter the folder
cd file

# Clone Files
Open the file folder in your preferred IDE
It is necessary that the two files.py are in the same folder

```
# *üëçEmphasis*
- Excellent teaching, especially for beginners;
- Good balance between theory and practice;
- Hill exercises to put into practice and learn more;
